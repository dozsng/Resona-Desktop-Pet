# ⚙️ Backend Service Modules

Located in `resona_desktop_pet/backend/`, these modules handle AI logic and audio processing.

## 1. LLM Module (`llm_backend.py`)
Handles communication with various LLM APIs.
- **History Management**: The `ConversationHistory` class automatically maintains the last N rounds of dialogue.
- **Multi-Model Adapters**:
  - `query_openai_compatible`: Supports DeepSeek, GPT-4, LocalLLM, etc.
  - `query_gemini`: Specifically adapted for Google Gemini's history format.
  - `query_claude`: Supports Anthropic Claude.
- **Thinking Process Support**: Extracts and logs `<think>` tag content from models like R1 and Claude.
- **Automatic Parsing**: Robustly parses LLM JSON responses into `LLMResponse` objects (emotion, display text, TTS text).

## 2. TTS Module (`tts_backend.py`)
Converts text to speech.
- **GPT-SoVITS Integration**: Communicates with the local inference server via HTTP API.
- **Emotion Mapping**: Maps LLM emotion tags (e.g., `<E:smile>`) to specific reference audio (`ref_wav`) and annotation text (`ref_text`) defined in the active pack's `emotions.json`.
- **Dynamic Loading**: Automatically updates reference assets when switching resource packs without restarting.

## 3. STT Module (`stt_backend.py`)
Handles speech recognition.
- **SenseVoice Engine**: Uses the offline SenseVoice model for high-speed and accurate recognition.
- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Automatically stops recording and starts recognition after a period of silence.
- **Hotkey Binding**: Supports global hotkeys (default `Alt+Q`) to trigger voice interaction.

## 4. SoVITS Manager (`sovits_manager.py`)
Manages the SoVITS background process.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automatically locates the `GPT-SoVITS` path, starts the API server on launch, and cleans up processes on exit.
- **Runtime Support**: Supports starting via the project's built-in streamlined runtime environment.
