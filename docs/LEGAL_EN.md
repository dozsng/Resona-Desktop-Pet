## 1. Assets and Copyright Statement
- **Third-Party Assets**: The copyright and related rights for character images, sprites, audio, and derivative materials in the default resource pack belong to their original rights holder, **Navel (Omega Vision, Inc.)**.
- **Speech Recognition Component**: The `setup.ps1` installation script in this project downloads and uses the SenseVoiceSmall speech recognition model developed and open-sourced by Alibaba Group (FunASR), following the FunASR Model License 1.1. This script uses the ONNX converted version provided by the k2-fsa / sherpa-onnx project.
- **Asset Distribution**: This repository does not distribute the aforementioned copyrighted assets. Assets obtained by users via scripts are for personal research and exchange only. This tool supports mounting external resources, and any URLs appearing in installation scripts are for functional demonstration of a general-purpose download engine. Any credentials to access these resources are time-sensitive and may expire at any time. The author strongly recommends users purchase genuine software from Navel through legal channels to obtain original content.
- **Developer Position**: The developer does not maintain, store, or recommend any specific resource links. Users who obtain unauthorized materials by modifying scripts do so at their own copyright risk. The author provides only a technical framework and has no ownership or control over content stored in third-party repositories.
- **Usage Requirements**: Related resources are for personal learning and technical exchange only; users should delete them within 24 hours of downloading. Users are responsible for judging the legality of downloaded content and bear corresponding legal consequences.
- **Placeholder Note**: Strings, pathnames, and renaming logic included in installation scripts are for example placeholder and program testing/debugging purposes only. This program does not have the capability to recognize specific copyrighted content. Users can modify them to any legal and compliant identifiers as needed. Their purpose is to demonstrate the program's ability to parse specific file structures and does not represent any association between this software and the real or fictional entities corresponding to those identifiers.

## 2. Content Generation and AI Responsibility
- **AI Generated Content**: This project assumes no responsibility for AI-generated content (including but not limited to AI model weights, sprites, audio, or LLM output text) included in resource packs, nor does it represent the author's views.
- **Infringement Risk**: Users bear all risks of infringement and ethical controversies arising from the use of AI-generated content. Copyright for resources obtained via scripts or third-party channels belongs to the original authors. Please ensure usage complies with relevant laws and asset licensing agreements.
- **Model Weights**: AI model weights involved in resource packs are for technical exchange only. Do not use them for illegal purposes or unauthorized commercial activities.
- **Content Labeling**: If users use this project and third-party models to generate content and disseminate it publicly, they must add explicit labels according to local laws and regulations. Legal liabilities arising from the user's failure to perform labeling obligations have nothing to do with this project.

## 3. Technical Limitations and Disclaimers
- **Code Generation**: Parts of the code and documentation in this project were generated using Large Language Models.
- **API Usage**: This project bears no responsibility if your API quota is over-consumed due to misconfiguration or frequent operations. Users should properly safeguard their API credentials. This project is not responsible for security breaches caused by improper user handling or the system's operating environment.
- **System Support**: This project only supports Windows and does not guarantee operation in any special environment or version of Windows. Software stability depends on the user's local environment, and the author does not promise any form of technical support.
- **Code Condition**: The code implementation of this project is somewhat messy; it is not recommended for anyone to read the source code. This project serves only as a personal technical experiment.
- **Black/Grey Market Disclaimer**: If any organization or individual uses vulnerabilities, code logic, or derivative tools of this project for black/grey market activities, or attempts to associate it with copyright-protected assets through reverse engineering, the resulting legal risks have nothing to do with the author of this project.
- **Software Warranty**: This software is provided "as is," and the author does not guarantee its stability. The author is not responsible for any direct or indirect losses (including but not limited to data loss, API debt, hardware damage, etc.) caused by using this software and related scripts.

## 4. Privacy and Security
- **Privacy Protection**: This project does not upload any of your personal information. It only connects to the internet when specific items in the configuration file are enabled, and the communication process is transparent in the logs.
- **Data Security**: Since this project involves file reading/writing and system calls, please back up important data before use.

## 5. External Links and Third-Party Services
- **External Servers**: Users must find and configure external resource packs that comply with this project's interface specifications. Paths provided in example scripts are for technical demonstration only. This repository does not assume any auditing obligation for the availability or legality of content on external servers.
- **Link Endorsement**: External resource links included in installation scripts are provided by community contributors or as technical path demonstrations. This repository does not endorse, review, or store content pointed to by these links. URLs referenced in scripts are for network connectivity testing only and do not represent the author's confirmation of the content at those addresses.
- **Autonomous Actions**: Operations such as file renaming and path mapping during script execution are the user's autonomous actions in their local environment. If copyright holders believe relevant links are infringing, please contact the third-party storage service provider. If confirmed, the author will remove the relevant example code upon receiving official notice.

## 6. Compliance and Agreement Modification
- **Legal Compliance**: When using this project to generate content, users should comply with local laws and regulations and must not use this project to create or disseminate false information or illegal content. If users engage in illegal activities using this project, they bear all consequences.

Any resemblance is purely coincidental. Any names or identifiers displayed in the software are test placeholders, and users can define them freely. Any variable naming or folder names appearing in the code are due to the developer's personal habits or common technical naming conventions; any resemblance is purely coincidental.
- **Rights Handling**: If rights holders believe that the code or documentation of this project infringes their rights, please provide proof of ownership via an Issue. The author will handle it within 72 hours of verification. The author cannot technically intervene in infringements caused by third-party resource packs prepared by users themselves.
- **Agreement Modification**: The author reserves the right to modify this agreement and stop maintaining this project at any time. For users who violate this agreement, the author has the right to revoke their usage authorization and pursue relevant responsibilities.
